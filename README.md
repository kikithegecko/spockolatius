# Spockolatius
So you probably know Spekulatius cookies, they come in finely detailed designes, are crunchy and usually taste like winter spices with a hint of caramel. The most interesting thing about them (from a baker's perspective) is that they are formed with special wooden molds to achieve this special look.

Since I'm all into winter/christmas cookies and puns, I am now making my own Spekulatius cookie mold with Star Trek designs. They are based on vector graphics by Juliane Busse (Thylnerfresh) and will be CNC milled on a 15 x 20 cm piece of linden wood.

### A note on wood
If you want to reproduce this (or make cookie molds with your own designs), choose the wood wisely. The [German Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(Form)#Nahrungsmittelerzeugung_und_Haushalt) says that cookie mold wood should be hard and of delicate structure, such as pear or linden wood. They also have the nice property of staying smooth during and after cleaning with water.
